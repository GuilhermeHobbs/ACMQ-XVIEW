# ACMQ-XVIEW
Graphical User Interface for Pascal/C/C++ by Dr. Antonio Carlos Moreirao de Queiroz.

  The XView-PC graphical user interface attempts to be similar to the XView
toolkit used in Sun workstations, in a simplified form.
  The interface was initially developed as an intermediate step in porting
programs from the PC to Sun workstations, by implementing a subset of the
Sun XView toolkit in the PC. The work was not completed because it soon
become clear that a total translation would be unnecessarily complex. Even
so, the working of the two interfaces was kept similar when reasonable.
  What can be done with the interface in its present form can be repeated
with the Sun XView without significant structural changes, although with
differences due to the various simplifications made. The porting of an
application to Windows is also not complex.
